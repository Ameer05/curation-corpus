## The Curation Corpus Dataset for Abstractive Text Summarisation
The Curation Corpus is a collection of 40,000 professionally-written summaries of news articles, with links to the articles themselves. This repository provides a scraper to access them. If you're interested in commercial use or access to the wider catalogue of Curation data, including a larger set of over 150,000 professionally-written abstracts and a scalable, on-demand content abstraction API (driven by humans or AI), please get in touch. For our thoughts on how we hope this release will help the NLP community, see our [announcement here](https://medium.com/curation-corporation/teaching-an-ai-to-abstract-a-new-dataset-for-abstractive-auto-summarisation-5227f546caa8). 

### Instructions
> * Clone this repository
> * Download the urls, headlines, and summaries from here
> * Run `scraper.py`. Larger batch sizes will make it run faster but it may drop more articles due to timeouts. I recommend ~50 on a 2015 Macbook Pro. 

### Tutorials
We are still learning about this field ourselves and will publish share our tutorials here. If you use our dataset in your own research, write a tutorial, or have anything you would like to share, let us know and we will link to it here. To kick things off, here is our first attempt: 

**Finetuning the BertSumExtAbs model from [Liu and Lapata 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345)**
